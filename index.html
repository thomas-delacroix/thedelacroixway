                <p>
                    Hi, I’m Thomas de la Croix—or just Thomas for short. My name
                    is new to me; it’s not my first, and there’s a lot of
                    history behind that change. Growing up, I never felt
                    connected to my given name—a gift from a father who wasn’t
                    kind, present, or supportive. Over six years ago, in the
                    midst of questioning my identity and undergoing a total
                    mental breakdown, I began to reimagine who I wanted to be.
                    Mental health has been a difficult topic in my family, often
                    brushed aside, which left me battling depression and anxiety
                    on my own. For three years, I barely left my room, unable to
                    connect with the world outside. But now, after years of
                    healing and reflection, I’m living authentically with my
                    boyfriend of 15 years, Matthew, and our beloved pitbull mix,
                    Buddy—who came into our lives after the devastating Camp
                    Fire in Paradise, CA.

                <h2>Why This Blog?</h2>
                <p>
                    After years of isolation and rebuilding my life, I wanted to
                    create a space to share my journey—the highs, the lows, and
                    everything in between. This blog is a reflection of my
                    passions, my growth, and the lessons I’ve learned. From
                    overcoming debilitating health challenges to building a
                    fulfilling life, I’m here to inspire, teach, and connect
                    with you through shared interests and honest storytelling.

                <h2>My Style</h2>
                <p>
                    My personal aesthetic is a mix of classy and trashy, retro
                    and futuristic. Think blood red and yellow tones with plaid
                    and cyberpunk patterns. My content is designed to be bold
                    and modern yet approachable, with clean layouts and
                    interactive touches to keep things dynamic and engaging.
